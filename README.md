# dice_rolls
Basic code which allows the user to decide the size of a dice and how many rolls they want. The program then produces a random number like a dice roll for the requested number of times. 

Simply copy the code or download the .py file to use the code in any IDE. 

To use the program run it in an IDE, for example PyCharm (CTRL + Shift + F10 to run). Enter the number of sides of a dice, then enter how many rolls you want that dice to do. The maximum is currently set to 5 rolls but that can be changed in the for loop.

Any improvements welcome.
